        <p data-scroll>Harley Quinn is a staple villian in the DC Comic universe.
          She is a playful character that is known for her zany clown-themed
          costumes and association with Batman's archnemesis: the Joker. <br> <br>
          She has been featured in two movies in the DC expanded universe: Suicide Squad,
          which was directed by a man, and Birds of Prey, which was directed by a woman. <br><br>
          Let's investigate the difference in her portrayal, as played by the same actress, Margot Robbie.</p>

        <p data scroll>This picture shows the commonly accepted "best" angle for women to take selfies. <br> <br>
          At first glance, this may seem inconsequential-- however, the camera is actually taking a position of authority.
          <br><br> The camera is <i>above</i> the woman, looking down at her. This makes her a smaller, diminutive entity. <br> <br>
          If you think about the camera as a type of gaze-- as it creates the way that the audience of the photo will view the subject--
          It is enforcing the type of misogyny perpetrated by the aforementioend male gaze.

        If we apply the same logic as above, men are depicting themselves neutrally, or even in a <i>position of power</i>: taking the image

        it does create and reinforce patriarchal power structures.
