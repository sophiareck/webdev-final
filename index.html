        <p data-scroll>Harley Quinn is a staple villian in the DC Comic universe.
          She is a playful character that is known for her zany clown-themed
          costumes and association with Batman's archnemesis: the Joker. <br> <br>
          She has been featured in two movies in the DC expanded universe: Suicide Squad,
          which was directed by a man, and Birds of Prey, which was directed by a woman. <br><br>
          Let's investigate the difference in her portrayal, as played by the same actress, Margot Robbie.</p>
